# Carbon Black API 

## Overview

Carbon Black includes extensive support for programmatic access to the underlying data and configuration via APIs.

There are three primary APIs:

* Carbon Black Client API (CBCAPI)
* Carbon Black Server API (CBSAPI)
* Carbon Black Feed API (CBFAPI)

## Carbon Black Client API

The Carbon Black Client API (CBCAPI) is found on github at:

  https://github.com/carbonblack/cbapi/client_apis

The CBCAPI is a collection of documentation, example scripts, and a helper library to allow for querying the backend data store and getting and setting configuration.  This is the same API that the Carbon Black web console uses to interface with the Carbon Black server.

## Carbon Black Server API

The Carbon Black Server API (CBSAPI) is found on github at:

  https://github.com/carbonblack/cbapi/server_apis

The CBSAPI is a collection of documentation, example scripts, and a helper library to help subscribe to Carbon Black server notifications, parse and understand the contents of those notifications, and demonstrate common business logic uses of those notifications.

## Carbon Black Feed API

The Carbon Black Feed API (CBFAPI) is found on github at:

  https://github.com/carbonblack/cbfeeds

The CBFAPI is a collection of documentation, example scripts, and a helper library to help build and validate Carbon Black feeds.
